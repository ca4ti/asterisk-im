S.410 Media Services API
</p>
<h3>Overview of S.410 Revision 2 (JTAPI Media Version 1.4)</h3>

ECTF S.410 defines the <a href="javax/telephony/media/package-summary.html">media package</a> for the Java Telephony API (JTAPI).
This API
is suitable for applications doing <i>content</i> processing, 
independent of the call setup, signalling and routing.
For example, S.410 is designed to simplify applications that implement
interactive voice response (IVR) systems,
auto-attendant or <i>robotic</i> agents (versus <i>live</i> operators),
voice mail, speech recognition, text-to-speech, fax, integrated messaging, etc.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.ectf.org/pages/pubdocs/c100r2/index.html">
ECTF C.100</a> defines the Core and Call Control extension packages of JTAPI.
The C.100 API is suitable for applications doing detailed call control,
monitoring/routing calls in a PBX (or other switching system),
managing a call center, controlling a phone terminal,
and other activities concerned with call states and signalling.
</p>

<h3>A guide to the classes:</h3>
<p>
To help guide you through the new classes,
here is a brief tour of the package/class structure:
</p>

<h4>S.410 Media Async Package</h4>
<p>
The "<tt>async</tt>" package is pure interface.
It establishes an interface structure and naming convention that 
is echoed in the provider classes that implement those interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The Async package defines the MediaService methods for asynchronous methods;
methods that return an <tt>Async.Event</tt> object. 
The <tt>Async.Event</tt> is delivered to the application via
an Async.MediaListener that is notified by <i>callback</i>
when the operation is complete. 
Alternatively, an application  can <i>wait</i> for completion 
of the Event, and proceed from there
(which is how the <i>synchronous</i> methods in the S.410 Media Package
 are defined and implemented).
</p>

<h4>S.410 Media Package</h4>
<p>
Most of the S.410 API is defined by interfaces. The centerpiece is 
the <tt>MediaService</tt> interface which defines the standard 
methods to access and control the media streams of a call.
As an aid to application developers, a MediaService implementation class
(<tt>BasicMediaService</tt>) is also supplied.
<p>
</p>
The reference implementation of <tt>BasicMediaService</tt>
inherits virtually all its implementation 
from the <tt>provider.Base_MediaService</tt> class.  
A particular vendor/supplier of S.410 may implement some other way.
<tt>BasicMediaService.java</tt> contains the required Constructors 
plus machine generated code for each resource-specific method 
that delegates to vendor-supplied implementation code.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> <tt>Base_MediaService.java</tt> does not implement the Resource behaviors,
it is just a framework mediating the interface between the Application 
and a Vendor-supplied MPI implemetation.
</p>
<p>
The resource-specific methods in <tt>Base_MediaService.java</tt>
convert the Resource method calls into a 
<tt>Request</tt> which is forwarded to the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>
using <tt>invokeGroupMethod</tt>. That protected method invokes 
the Resource-specific method on the currently bound <tt>MediaGroup</tt>.
In this way, the public API methods do not expose access to the
<tt>MediaGroup</tt> or the vendor-supplied implementation methods.
</p>
<tt>Base_MediaService</tt> is described in
<a href="javax/telephony/media/provider/package-summary.html#msb">
the provider package</a>.
</p>
<h4>S.410 Media Provider Package</h4>
<p>
The <tt>media.provider</tt> package contains implementation code
for several "standard" components for building a media "Peer".
<ul> <li>
The interfaces between the main components are defined in the <tt>MPI</tt>.
</li> <li>
A <tt>MediaPeer</tt> supplies a <tt>MediaProvider</tt>. [to parallel JTAPI core]
<li> </li>
A <tt>MediaProvider</tt> supplies a <tt>GroupProvider</tt> [akin to the S.100 SCR]
<li> </li>
A <tt>GroupProvider</tt> supplies the <tt>MediaGroups</tt>.
<li> </li>
A <tt>MediaGroup</tt> is bound to a <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>, and
delivers <tt>MediaEvents</tt> to Listeners of the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>.
<li>
<tt>Base.Event</tt> implements the required MediaEvents.
</li> <li>
<tt>Dispatcher</tt> works with the <tt>Base.Events</tt> to dispatch events
to the correct Listeners of the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>.
</li> <li>
<tt>BasicMediaService</tt> extends <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>;
all <tt>Resource</tt> methods and other extensions beyond <tt>MediaService</tt>
are found using a <tt>Request</tt> object 
which uses <tt>Base_MediaService.getTargetForMethod()</tt> to find
the Resource/Extension component.
</li> </ul>
<p>
The Provider package defines an interoperability interface between the
<tt>BasicMediaService</tt> object and any vendor's implementation.  
The Provider package contains reference implementation classes for 
the <tt>Async.Event</tt> objects (<tt>Base.Event</tt>), 
and reference implementations for Event dispatching and Listener management. 
The vendor specific extensions are constrained
to meet the "Media Provider's Interface" (the MPI), and the various
interfaces are defined as nested interfaces within <tt>MPI.java</tt>.
<P>
The Provider package is, in effect, a "Media Provider developer's toolkit".
Media implementations based on the Provider package should result in
compatible and interoperable implementations. Hopefully, a single
application (a single <tt>BasicMediaService</tt> object)
could utilize <tt>MediaGroups</tt> from different, independently 
developed MediaPeer suppliers.
<br>That is the goal...
<p>
For more details, see the
<a href="javax/telephony/media/provider/package-summary.html">Provider Package</a>
<p>

<h4>JTAPI core</h4>
<p>
There are only a few JTAPI core items that are actually 
referenced in S.410: the Provider, Call, Connection and Terminal,
plus one or two Exceptions.
</p>
<p>
From the top, there is the master factory: <tt>JTAPIPeerFactory</tt>, 
which loads [using <tt>class.forName()</tt>] a <tt>JTAPIPeer</tt>. 
A <tt>JTAPIPeer</tt> is a vendor supplied factory that supplies a <tt>Provider</tt>
(based on a "login/session" to a "server").
A Provider is a vendor supplied factory that supplies <tt>Call</tt>, 
<tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Terminal</tt> and other objects.
The methods for managing and monitoring a "call" are spread among 
those interfaces, plus their CallControl and CallCenter extensions.
</p>

<h3>New in S.410 Release 2:</h3>
This section describes the new packages and interfaces in S.410-R2.
<ol> <li>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/Delegation.html">Delegation interface</a>
provides access to the "complex handoff" services of an ECTF media server.
These services allow cooperating appications to share 
control of a call using an "owner stack" with complete
control of <i>return</i> and <i>throw</i> capabilities.
Delegation includes methods for: <tt>delegateToService, release, retrieve</tt>.
</li><li>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/ASR.html">ASR interface</a>
is a translation of the ASR interface from ECTF S.100-R2.
</li><li>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/TTSPlayer.html">TTS interface</a>
extends the Player Resource to include control of  TTS pronounciation 
dictionaries.
</li><li>
The 
<a href="javax/telephony/media/async/package-summary.html#package_description">
async package</a> 
defines interfaces for non-blocking versions of the MediaService
and Resource methods, plus the associated Events and Listeners.
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/async/Async.html">Async interface</a> 
contains nested interfaces for Async MediaService Events and their Listeners
plus the 
<a href="javax/telephony/media/async/Async.MediaService.html">Async.MediaService interface</a>
for MediaService methods.
Each of the Resources has its own Async_<i>Resource</i> interface
for Methods, Events and Listeners.
</li><li>
The
<a href="javax/telephony/media/provider/package-summary.html">
Provider Package</a> is a "reference implementation" framework, 
or a "provider developer's toolkit". 
The MediaService, Resource, and Async methods are all implemented 
by "<tt>BasicMediaService</tt>" which extends 
the "<tt>provider.Base_MediaService</tt>" class.
<br>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/provider/Base_MediaService.html">
Base_MediaService</a> class
implements bind/release and all the event and Listener management
for <tt>MediaService</tt> and <tt>Async.MediaService</tt> methods.
<br>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/provider/MPI.html">
Media Provider Interface (MPI)</a>
defines the interface to the provider package's reference framework.
Vendors can support S.410 simply by implementing to the MPI 
and leverage the (provider package) reference implementation
of Base_MediaService, Base events, and the EventQueue and Dispatcher.
</li><li>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/connection/package-summary.html">
Media Connection Package</a> enables Group-to-Group media connections.
</li><li>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/container/package-summary.html">
Container Package</a> enables S.410 applications to read/write the
contents for Media Data Objects.
</li><li>
The <a href="javax/telephony/media/messaging/package-summary.html">
Messaging Package</a> enables S.410 applications to find other ECTF
applications and exchange messages (commands and events).
</li>
