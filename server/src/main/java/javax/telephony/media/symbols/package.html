An Implementation of Symbols for ECTF
</P>

<h3>
Package Overview 
</h3>
<p>
The <tt>symbol</tt> package contains the actual Symbol
definitions for the ECTF Symbols. 
Symbols are of Objects that wrap a controlled set <tt>int</tt> values.
Symbols are similar to <tt>Integers</tt>, except they are not useful
for arithmetic operations: Symbols are <i>nominal</i> but not <i>metric</i>.
<p>
The <tt>int</tt> value of a Symbol is structured to represent
the canonical print name of that Symbol. That is, 
a Symbol's value can be parsed into a Format, Vendor, Object and ItemName.
The various Format classes determine how to parse the internal
bit fields, as defined by ECTF.
and the Stringifier class defines methods to compose printable
names for particular Symbols.
<p>
This is a separate package from "javax.telephony.media" 
because these definitions are not relevant 
to the <i>application</i> programmer. 
(and javadoc generates reams of useless information)
<p>
This is a separate package from "javax.telephony.media.provider"
because these Symbol value definitions are invariant across 
any an all provider implementations. Symbol values are defined and
controlled by the ECTF and the ECTF Vendor ID registry.

<p>
The definitions of the symbol values and their
canonical names are important for application portability.
All media provider implementers must use compatible definitions.
