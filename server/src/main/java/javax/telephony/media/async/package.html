<p>
Defines asynchronous methods, events and Listeners for the media package.
</P>
<h3>
Package Overview 
</h3>
<p>
The <tt>async</tt> package defines interfaces for asynchronous
MediaService methods, asynchronous Events, Listener callback interfaces,
and asynchronous Resource interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The asynchronous MediaService method definitions are derived from
the synchronous method definitions. 
<tt>Async.MediaService</tt> defines a method corresponding to each
synchronous MediaService method.
For each synchronous <tt>methodName(arglist)</tt>, 
the corresponding asynchronous methods is named:
<tt>async_methodName</tt>.
The async method has exactly the same <tt>arglist</tt> 
as the synchronous <tt>methodName</tt>.
The return values are always some <tt>Async.Event</tt>,
specialized as necessary to contain any return values.
In all cases, the asynchronous methods have exactly 
the same argument signature as the synchronous counterpart, 
and always return an <tt>Async.Event</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The same rules apply to Resource methods.
Most synchronous Resource methods return some MediaEvent.
For example <tt>play</tt> returns a <tt>PlayerEvent</tt>.
The corresponding asynchronous method returns an Async.Event
named by prepending "Async_".
For example, <tt>async_play</tt> returns <tt>Async_PlayerEvent</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Theory of Operation:</h3>
</P>
<p>
All MediaService and Resource methods are internally invoked using
the async interfaces.  The return value from all async methods is
some specialization of Async.Event. The synchronous transaction
methods block waiting until the Async.Event is done.  
An event <i>is done</i> when the transaction is complete
and the return values from the operation have been stored in the
event.  When the event is done, the synchronous MediaService methods
return the value of interest as extracted from the event 
(or return void, if there is no interesting value).
The synchronous Resource method return the event itself;
the event acts like a multiple-value return structure.
<p>
In contrast, the asychronous methods immediately and directly 
return the Async.Event object. The application has limited access 
to the fields of the event until the event is done.  Two event 
accessors are always (or immediately) accessible: the EventID and 
the Event source (a MediaService). The methods <tt>getEventID()</tt> 
and <tt>getSource()</tt> (or the equivalent <tt>getMediaService()</tt>)
return these values.
The other fields of an event are not accessible until the event
is done.
</p><p>
If a transactional method completes with an error status,
then the event contains an Exception.  The synchronous API methods
extract and throw that error (using <tt>throwIfXXXException()</tt>.  
The asychronous API methods <i>never</i> throw the Exceptions created
from transactional errors. 
However, asynchronous methods <i>may</i> throw Exceptions based on 
analysis at invocation time (precondition errors). 
The application should check for errors using <tt>getException()</tt>
or for Resource events one can also use <tt>getError()</tt>.
</p><p>
An application can synchronize with an event (wait for it to be done)
in several ways:
<ol>
<li>Invoke the <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> method directly. 
    The <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> method blocks until the event is done, 
    and then returns.
    [the invoking Thread is blocks using Thread.wait() and is
     released by notifyAll() when the event is done.]</li>
<li>Invoke an event accessor 
    (other than <tt>getEventID()</tt> or <tt>getMediaService()</tt>).
    All event accessors internally call <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> before
    extracting values from the event.</li>
<li>Invoke the event method <tt>isDone()</tt> to effect a "polling" test.
    <tt>isDone()</tt> returns <tt>false</tt> if <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> 
    would block.
    [internally <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> blocks until <tt>isDone()</tt>
     returns <tt>true</tt>.]</li>
<li>Establish a Listener for the event of interest. 
    The listener callback is invoked when the event is done.</li>
<li>Invoke the <tt>waitForListenersDone()</tt> method. 
    The <tt>waitForListenersDone()</tt> method blocks until 
    the event is done and all Listeners have run, and then returns.
    This method is used the synchronouse API methods.
    </li>
</ol>
Note that synchronous tranasction methods do generate asynchronous
events internally, and those events <i>are</i> delivered to listeners.
Note also that the event objects returned from synchronous Resource
methods are guarenteed to be <i>done</i> when the method returns.
Furthermore, the synchronous API guarantees that all listeners
have been notified before the method returns.
</p><p>
As always, the order in which listeners are invoked is indeterminate.
</p><p>

<H3>Asynchronous Usage Scenarios</H3>
<P>There are several scenarios in which one may want to use
the asynchronous methods:
</P>
<OL><LI>
For an event driven application;
that is, a state-machine implemented in the Listeners.
This is the classical reason to use asynchronous methods.
</P><P>
From within a Listener callback,
one can initiate <tt>async_doSomething(...)</tt>.
When that completes, some other Listener method will be invoked.
<p><b>Note:</b> Do <STRONG>not</STRONG> invoke synchronous methods
from within a Listener. This will block the Listener thread,
and may hang the application.
</p>
</LI><LI>
To get several requests going at the same time.
One example would be to start several play requests with
<tt>(p_IfBusy = v_Queue)</tt>.
Another example would be to destroy several Containers in parallel:
<PRE>
ev1 = containerService.async_destroy(cont1, null);
ev2 = containerService.async_destroy(cont2, null);
ev3 = containerService.async_destroy(cont3, null);
// All three operations are started.
// Could do other stuff at this point...
// Now: wait for them all to finish.
ev1.waitForListenersDone();
ev2.waitForListenersDone();
ev3.waitForListenersDone();
// Note: the order we wait does not matter
// We get to this point if/only-if all events are done.
// and now we can check for errors, or whatever.
</PRE>
<P><b>Note:</b> A similar 
  result could be achieved with multiple threads each calling a synchronous 
  method, but then you need to join the threads. This method is easier, and 
  requires less overhead in many cases.
</P>
</LI><LI>
To impose a timeout for event completion:
<PRE>
ev = async_doSomething(...);
ev.waitForEventDone(myTimeout);
if (!ev.isDone()) {  doSomethingTimedOut(); }
</PRE>
</LI><LI>
To prevent exceptions from being thrown;
but instead check for them by querying the event object:
<PRE>
ev = async_doSomething(...);
if (!ev.getError().equals(Error_OK)) { processError(...); }
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
if (ev.getException() != null) { processError(...); }
</PRE>
</LI><LI>
To get the whole event object;
not the single derived value or void returned by a sync method:
<PRE>
ev = async_doSomething(...);
Dictionary payload = ev.getPayload();
</PRE>
</LI></OL>
<P>
<b>Note:</b> The synchronous methods are built from the async methods.
The synchronizing wrapper creates an event and starts to operation,
blocks on the event, extracts any exception and throws it,
and may extract and return a particular field of the event.
As shown above, async methods can be used directly to bypass any or all
of the wrapper actions.
