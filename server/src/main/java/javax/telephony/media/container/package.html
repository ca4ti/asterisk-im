Defines the Media ContainerService and Media DataObject interfaces
for the media package.

<H3>
Package Overview
</h3>
<p>
The ContainerProvider is an <i>optional</i> interface that may
be implemented by a MediaProvider.

<h3>Overview</h3>
The Container Management API provides an operating system independent
mechanism for the storage and interchange of system data.
A Container is an object logically residing in the file system of
a CT Server and containing zero or more Data Objects. 
Data Objects are made up of data and a set
of attributes describing the properties of the data.

<h3>Why Use Containers?</h3>
The API uses containers, rather than simply specifying pathnames in either
the client or server operating systems, so that the server can augment
the normal features found in OS file systems with the features required by
Resources to manipulate media data in a convenient manner. For example, 
a directory on the server containing a <tt>.WAV</tt> file may be manipulated
more conveniently by using the Container API that treats it as a 
a Container with a Media Data Object (or possibly a collection of such objects)
with appropriate coder, data rate, and other parameters defined for it.
<p>
In many ways Containers and Data Objects are analogous to file systems and
their files. The primary difference is that the Container interface is
independent of the actual storage strategies employed. That is, it is
independent of the storage medium, and of the data type, formatting and
organization.
<p>
<h3> Using Containers </h3>
The working methods for this package are in the ContainerService interface.
A ContainerService object is obtained from the ContainerProvider/MediaProvider.
<p>
A ContainerProvider object is obtained by checking <tt>instanceof</tt> 
and then casting the MediaProvider to a ContainerProvider.
<br>
For example: <pre>
    MediaProvider mp = ...;
    ContainerService cs = null;
    if (mp instanceof ContainerProvider) 
       cs = ((ContainerProvider)mp).getContainerService();
    ...
</pre>
<p>
Most of the interesting methods are defined in

and <a href="DataObject.html">DataObject</a>.
