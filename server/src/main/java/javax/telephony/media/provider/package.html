<p>
A reference implementation, MediaPeer and MediaProvider developer's toolkit 
and interoperability framework for the media package. 
</P>
<h3>
Package Overview 
</h3>
<p>
The provider package is <b>not</b> part of the media package 
Application Programmer's Interface (API). 
This package is included to help platform vendors develop
compatible and interoperable MediaPeer and MediProvider objects.
<p>
To obtain source or binary implemetation of the provider package contact the
<a href="mailto: jeff.peck@intel.com">JSR-043 spec lead</a>.
</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>
The <tt>provider</tt> package defines interfaces for interoperability
between the standard MediaService object [<tt>BasicMediaService</tt>], 
and a vendor-specific implementation.  As a reference implementation,
the provider package 
(in particular <tt>Base.Event</tt> and <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>) 
defines the relationships and sequencing for bind and release, synch/async
event management, add/remove Listeners and dispatching of events
to the appropriate Listener.
<p>
<tt>provider.Base.Event</tt> is a reference implementation of
<tt>Async.Event</tt> [and its subclasses].
<tt>Base.Event</tt> is integrated with the <tt>EventQueue</tt>
and <tt>Dispatcher</tt> classes
that manage Listeners and asynchronous Event dispatching.
<p>
The interface from the provider package framework to the 
vendor-specific or platform-specific code is defined by the 
"Media Provider's Interface" (MPI). To use the provider package,
the MPI and its sub-interfaces must be implemented by a
vendor's platform-specific code.
<p>
<a href="Base_MediaService.html"><tt>Base_MediaService</tt></a> 
defines the operational relationship between
the API (the standard <tt>BasicMediaService</tt> class) and the MPI.
<p>
<a href="MPI.html">MPI</a> defines the interface between the components of the 
provider package [Base_MediaService, Events, Dispatcher, Request, etc.]
and the vendor supplied objects:
<tt>MPI.MediaPeer</tt>, <tt>MPI.GroupProvider</tt>, <tt>MPI.MediaGroup</tt>,
and <tt>MPI.Resource</tt>. The other MPI interface (<tt>MPI.Owner</tt>)
is implemented by <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>.
<p>
Stub implementations of the vendor specific code are provided as:
<tt>NullMediaPeer</tt>, <tt>NullGroupProvider</tt>, <tt>NullMediaGroup</tt>. 
A vendor can extend these classes to build a working system.
<p>
[Sorry, there is not yet a <tt>NullResource</tt>,
that would get into the Resource SPI... @see ECTF-S.300 ]
<p>
<tt>Base.Event</tt> and its sub-classes provides a reference implementation 
of the <tt>Async.Event</tt> interfaces.
<tt>Base.Event</tt> works with the <tt>MPI.Owner</tt> interface as
implemented by <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>. That implementation uses the
<tt>EventQueue</tt> and <tt>Dispatcher</tt> mechanisms to allow
<tt>Base.Events</tt> to dispatch themselves to the appropriate Listeners.
<p>
<tt>Dispatcher</tt> implements the <tt>addListener</tt>
and <tt>removeListener</tt> methods, and defines a framework for 
queues and threads to handle asynchronous event processing.
</p>
<h3> Provider Package </h3>
<ul> <li>
The interfaces between the main components are defined in <tt>MPI</tt>.
</li> <li>
A <tt>MediaPeer</tt> supplies a <tt>MediaProvider</tt>. [to parallel JTAPI core]
</li> <li>
A <tt>MediaProvider</tt> supplies a <tt>GroupProvider</tt> [akin to the S.100 SCR]
</li> <li> 
A <tt>GroupProvider</tt> supplies the <tt>MediaGroups</tt>.
</li> <li> 
A <tt>MediaGroup</tt> is bound to a <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>,
and delivers <tt>MediaEvents</tt> to Listeners
of the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>.
</li> <li> 
<tt>Base.Event</tt> implements the required MediaEvents.
</li> <li> 
<tt>Dispatcher</tt> works with the <tt>Base.Events</tt> to dispatch events
to the correct Listeners of the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>.
</li> </ul>

<h5>Base_MediaService</h5>
<p>
<a href="Base_MediaService.html"><tt>Base_MediaService</tt></a> 
is the key to everything, and it is largely machine generated code
that passes API calls coming from the <tt>BasicMediaService</tt>
to the <tt>MediaGroup</tt> or the <tt>GroupProvider</tt> (via the <tt>MPI</tt>).
</p>
<p>
The <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> implementation contains code to handle events
and holds the <tt>GroupProvider</tt> and the currently bound
<tt>MediaGroup</tt>.  That is, <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> implements the
record-keeping for bind and release.
</p>
<h5>MediaProvider</h5>
<p>
The <tt>GroupProvider</tt> is obtained from the associated
<tt>MediaProvider</tt> 
(specified by name or value in the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> constructor).  
A <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> object is associated with a <tt>MediaProvider</tt> 
(by name or by value)
when the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> object is created.
</p>
<p>
How and where one gets a <tt>MediaProvider</tt> is intentionally vague.
The simplest is to use the <tt>JtapiPeerFactory</tt> to get a <tt>JtapiPeer</tt>,
and from there use <tt>getProvider(...)</tt>.  
If that <tt>Provider</tt> implements <tt>MediaProvider</tt>, 
it can be used directly.
Alternatively,
the default <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> object will use "system properties" 
to find the name of a <tt>MediaProvider</tt> implementation class. 
You can override the system property values by supplying
the name and "login" arguments directly to the
<tt>BasicMediaService</tt> constructor.
</p>
<p>
A <tt>MediaProvider</tt> supplies a "<tt>GroupProvider</tt>" 
(the agency responsible for handling bind/release requests; 
the S.410 abstraction of the SCR).
</p>
<p>
The <tt>GroupProvider</tt> handles bind requests by delivering instances of
a <tt>MediaGroup</tt> to the <tt>MediaService</tt> object 
[in <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>]. That constitutes the "binding" 
of the <tt>MediaService</tt> to that <tt>MediaGroup</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The various Media objects can be distinguished by their cardinality:
the collection of Providers (of a given JTAPIPeer) for one or
more actual "servers" could have *one* GroupProvider; each telephony
media stream (a CCR in S.100) would be associated with a MediaGroup;
and a MediaGroup can be passed among a series of MediaService objects
</p>

<h5>Other methods</h5>
<p>
After binding, API method invocations on the <tt>BasicMediaService</tt>
are passed to the <tt>MediaGroup</tt> and <tt>MediaEvents</tt> are returned. 
The <tt>MediaEvent</tt> (a <tt>Base.Event</tt>) contains 
the synchronizing info, status, "out" values, and any Exceptions
generated in the implementation thread. 
<p><b>Note:</b> the Exceptions are passed as data elements of the 
<tt>MediaEvent</tt>, and are only "thrown" if the API layer 
(<tt>BasicMediaService</tt>) 
invoked the operation as a synchronous call.
</p>
<p>
The "<tt>Request</tt>" object allows arbitrary [Resource] methods 
to be passed from the API (<tt>BasicMediaService</tt>) to the implementation
(whever implements the Resource inteface) without the middleware
(<tt>Base_MediaService</tt>) knowing about that method.  
[and without the API knowing about the Resource implementation object]
In effect, <tt>Base_MediaService</tt> acts as an aggregator for all the
<tt>MPI.Resource</tt> objects and their interfaces.
</p>
<a name="events"></a>
<h5>Events, Listeners and dispatch</h5>
<p>
All the events are implemented in Base.java.  Base.<tt>Event</tt> is 
designed to work with the <tt>Dispatcher</tt> and <tt>EventQueue</tt> 
supplied in the provider package.
Events in this scheme are "self-dispatching";
</p>
<p>
The <tt>Dispatcher</tt> sends Events to the correct Listener as follows:
<p>
For each Listener on the <tt>Base_MediaService</tt>, the Event is told:
"here is a Listener, if the Listener should be informed about you (this Event), 
then take care of it".  
Each Event has a "<tt>dispatch(Listener)</tt>" method that checks the type
of the Listener, and if the Listener supports this Event's interface,  
<tt>dispatch</tt> invokes the appropriate Listener callback method.
<p>
Thus, the EventQueue/Dispatcher don't need to know how or
where to send the event; each Event is specialized with a <tt>dispatch</tt>
method to test for its Listener, and invoke the documented callback method.
