/**
 * An RTC (Run Time Control) object associates a trigger condition
 * with some action.
 * When the Resource identified by the trigger condition emits an event
 * that corresponds to that condition, the action command is sent
 * to the Resource whose operation is being controlled by the RTC.
 * <p>
 * The RTC trigger Symbols are a subset of the event Symbols.  
 * The events available as RTC triggers are defined 
 * by the resource that generates them.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The name of an RTC <i>trigger</i> has the form:
 * <code>rtcc_&ltEventName&gt</code>.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The name of an RTC <i>action</i> has the form:
 * <code>rtca_&ltCommandName&gt</code>.
 * </li></ul>
 * <p>
 * For example:<pre>
 * static RTC speedUp = new RTC(SignalDetector.rtcc_Pattern[2],
 *                                      Player.rtca_SpeedUp);
 *        RTC[] rtcs = {speedUp};
 *        playEvent = play(..., rtcs, ...);</pre>
 * In this case, when the signal detector resource 
 * matches Pattern 2, the Player resource recieves the 
 * <code>Player.rtca_speedUp</code> command.
 * <p>
 * RTC objects typically appear in media transaction commands
 * as elements of the <code>RTC[] rtc</code> argument.
