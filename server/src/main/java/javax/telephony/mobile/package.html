	<P>
	  The JTAPI Mobile package extends the core capabilities of 
	  a JTAPI implementation with capabilities specific
	  to mobile networks.
	</P>

	<H2>Introduction</H2>
	<P>
	  The overall architecture of the JTAPI packages was designed 
	  to flexibly represent a wide range of telephony devices. While 
	  the advanced call control and call center packages provide added 
	  features for third party world view at switches and server 
	  applications, other packages are designed to enhance the terminal
	  side of first party only devices. e.g. the phone package for 
	  dealing with physical devices such as ringer, buttons and
	  hookswitches.
	</P>
	<P>
	  The Mobile package adds to the first party view of the telephony 
	  network the features needed to support the unique characteristics
	  visible to the  wireless network device endpoint. This package was 
	  initially designed with GSM networks in mind, but has been crafted to 
	  work well in other wireless networks as well.
	</P>

	<H2>Mobile device characteristics</H2>
	<P>
	  Several characteristics of the mobile device are worth highlighting 
	  here to understand some of the design decisions that were made in the
	  Mobile package that may appear contrary to design patterns used in
	  earlier releases of JTAPI :
	</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI> small footprint - mobile devices are typically very cost sensitive 
	  	and require drastic design choices in minimizing the overall footprint
	   	of interface and implementation of the telephony applications.
	  </LI>
	  <UL>
		<LI> No capabilities interfaces - optional static capabilities 
		  are supported via interfaces and checks for instance of 
		  interface.
		</LI>
		<LI> Listener events - Observer interfaces are typically bulky 
		  in the use of the class name space to convey individual state 
		  transitions.
		</LI>
		<LI>Return values - by defining meaningful return values for
		  methods that were unused fewer methods are required, e.g.
		  returning a null String for a get property operation for
		  an not supported operation, or returning a boolean to 
		  indicate the success or failure of an operation
		</LI>
		
		<LI> Exceptions - in cases where a partial implementation of a
		  feature are provided, exceptions can be used to provide
		  finer granularity of optional implementation features. e.g.
		  NetworkSelection scanning for networks may be provided
		  in an implementation that throws method not supported exceptions
		  if the scanning operation can not be canceled once started.
		</LI>
	  </UL>
	  <LI>Emergency Provider State  - in addition to basic in and out of 
		service states of the telephony network, the cellular network 
	  	attempts to provide emergency service even if the device has 
	    been compromised (SIM card removed), or the device is otherwise
		restricted (onboard a plane).
	  </LI>
	  <LI> Radio Management - mobile devices are very power conscious
	  	and the radio equipment very power intensive. Users typically 
		have the ability to control whether the radio functions of the
		devices are automatically enabled when the device is powered
		on or whether these features are managed separately from other
		Personal Information Management applications on the device.
	  </LI>

	  <LI> Network Selection - In many locations a mobile phone user
	  	has a choice of cellular networks. The selection mechanism
		might be automatic or intelligently chosen based on costs or
		even manually with end user intervention.
	  </LI>
	</UL>
	<H2>Network Types</H2>


	<P>
	  The term <STRONG>available network</STRONG> means a mobile cellular network that is in the
	  general geographical area as the mobile device such that the device can
	  detect and communicate with a cell of that network. And that the network can
	  offer, at a minimum, restricted communication service to the mobile device.
	</P>

	<P>
	  <STRONG>Current network</STRONG> refers to the mobile network service provider that the
	  mobile device is currently registered with. That is, the network the mobile
	  device is receiving communications through.
	</P>


	<P>
	  <STRONG>Home network</STRONG> is the network the mobile device has a subscription of service
	  with.
